Here, the head of the femur is discarded with the socket's surface layer wherein it rests. Hip joint's artificial components come in different shapes, sizes, and designs. And these are composed of cobalt, ceramic, titanium, and chrome materials. Some surgeons use customized components to enhance the femur fit. <br/> <br/>Hip replacement surgeons sometimes use a 'hybrid' technique consisting of the cemented femur and an uncemented acetabular part. Sometimes, the surgeon also uses a special cement or glue to fix the new parts of the hip to the healthy, existing bone - this is referred to as a 'cemented' process. Full recovery post-surgery can take about 3-6 months, depending on several factors such as surgery type and the patient's overall health.",

      description: "It is an innovative medical treatment gaining traction in orthopedics. It harnesses the body’s natural healing properties to aid in tissue repair and regeneration. This summary aims to provide an overview of PRP, its applications and the evidence supporting its effectiveness for patients considering this treatment.<br/><br/><b>What is Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)?</b><br/>PRP is a concentrated solution derived from the patient’s own blood. It contains a higher concentration of platelets, which are essential for blood clotting and contain growth factors that promote healing. The process involves drawing a small sample of the patient’s blood, which is then centrifuged to separate the platelets from other blood components.<br/><br/><b>Applications in Orthopaedics</b><br/>1. Osteoarthritis:<br/> PRP injections have shown promise in managing osteoarthritis, particularly in the knee and hip joints. Studies suggest that PRP may help reduce pain, improve function, and delay the progression of the disease.<br/>2. Tendon Injuries:<br/> PRP has been utilized in the treatment of various tendon injuries, including those in the Achilles, rotator cuff, and tennis elbow. Clinical evidence suggests that PRP may accelerate healing and enhance tissue quality in these cases.<br/>3. Ligament Injuries:<br/> PRP is being explored as an adjunctive treatment for ligament injuries, such as those in the knee’s anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Although research is ongoing, initial results are promising.<br/>4. Muscle Injuries:</br> PRP may aid in the recovery of muscle injuries, like strains and tears. It has shown potential in reducing pain and accelerating the healing process.<br/><br/><b>Evidence of effectiveness</b><br/>While research on PRP is ongoing, numerous studies have reported positive outcomes in orthopaedic applications. Clinical trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated benefits in terms of pain reduction, improved function, and enhanced tissue healing.<br/><b>Conclusion</b>Platelet-Rich Plasma is an evolving treatment option in orthopedics, offering a natural approach to tissue repair and regeneration. While research continues to refine its applications, early evidence suggests its potential benefits in managing various musculoskeletal conditions. If you are considering PRP, consult with your orthopaedic surgeon to discuss its suitability for your specific case.<br/><br/>Note: It is important to consult with your orthopeadic surgeon for personalised advice and treatment options based on your individual condition and medical history.",
