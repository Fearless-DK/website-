          description: 'Shoulder arthritis is usually the result of the gradual use of cartilage. Cartilage is present in every joint in the body; It covers the bone surface inside the joint, similar to Teflon on ball bearings. Cartilage is living tissue with a thickness of 2 to 3 millimetres – about one or two thick layers of cardboard. It softens contact between bones. If the cartilage is intact, it can make many turns without the surface’s wear because it is smooth.',
